   "Ciao,
    I’m Yuli, a future graphic designer! As for today, I’m a student, who passionately discovers all the magic of the communication design world. I study in the inspiring city of Milan and live in the romantic city of Como. Every day brings with it a new experience that inspires and build my inner world and my creative mind.
</p>
<p>
    In this webpage, I present you the most precious thing to me – my works. This portfolio is a little piece of me. So, I truly hope you will enjoy it."
